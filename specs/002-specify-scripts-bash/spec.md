# Feature Specification: Text-to-Video Generation

**Feature Branch**: `002-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement text-to-video generation functionality, integrating z.ai API endpoints, with user inputs for text prompts and output format selection."

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of text-to-video generation using z.ai API integration. The scope includes user interface for text input and format selection, video generation processing, progress tracking, and result management. This feature does not include video editing capabilities, advanced AI model training, or custom video effects beyond what z.ai API provides.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Video from Text Prompt (Priority: P1)

Users can input text prompts describing the video they want to generate and select desired output format. The system processes the request through z.ai API and generates a video based on the text description.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the feature - users must be able to generate videos from text to get value from the system

**Independent Test**: Users can enter a text prompt, select format, submit request, and receive a generated video without involving other user stories

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the text-to-video interface, **When** they enter a valid text prompt and select MP4 format, **Then** the system submits the request to z.ai API
2. **Given** a video generation request is submitted, **When** processing completes, **Then** the user receives a downloadable video in the selected format

---

### User Story 2 - Monitor Generation Progress (Priority: P1)

Users can track the progress of their video generation requests and receive notifications when videos are ready for download. The system provides real-time status updates during processing.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience - video generation takes time and users need visibility into the process

**Independent Test**: Users can submit a generation request and monitor progress without needing to access other features

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user submits a video generation request, **When** processing begins, **Then** the system displays real-time progress updates
2. **Given** video generation completes successfully, **When** the user is viewing the interface, **Then** they receive a notification that their video is ready

---

### User Story 3 - Access and Download Generated Videos (Priority: P1)

Users can preview, download, and manage their generated videos in various formats they selected during creation. The system provides a library of previously generated videos.

**Why this priority**: Critical for delivering value - users need to access and use the videos they've generated

**Independent Test**: Users can access their video library and download previously generated videos without creating new ones

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video generation is complete, **When** the user accesses their video library, **Then** they can preview the video before downloading
2. **Given** a user wants to save a generated video, **When** they click download, **Then** the system provides the video in their selected format

### Edge Cases

- What happens when z.ai API is unavailable or experiencing issues?
- How does system handle inappropriate or policy-violating text prompts?
- What occurs when video generation fails midway through processing?
- How does system handle very long text prompts or complex requests?
- What happens when user's internet connection is lost during generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### CLI Accessibility Requirements
*Per Constitution: CLI Interface Accessibility principle*

- **CLI-001**: System MUST expose all functionality via command-line interface
- **CLI-002**: System MUST support stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr protocol
- **CLI-003**: System MUST support JSON + human-readable output formats

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide text input interface for users to enter video generation prompts
- **FR-002**: System MUST offer format selection options for video output (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV)
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with z.ai API endpoints for text-to-video generation
- **FR-004**: System MUST display generation progress and status updates to users
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide video preview functionality before download
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable video download in selected format
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle API errors and provide user-friendly error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain user history of generated videos
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate text prompts before submission
- **FR-010**: System MUST estimate generation time for user expectations

### Key Entities

- **Video Generation Request**: User submission containing text prompt, format preferences, and generation parameters
- **Text Prompt**: User-provided description of desired video content and style
- **Output Format**: Video format selection (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.) and quality settings
- **Generation Job**: Processing task that tracks video creation progress and status
- **Generated Video**: Final video file produced by the system with metadata
- **User History**: Collection of user's previous video generation requests and results
- **API Configuration**: Connection settings and credentials for z.ai API integration
