# Feature Specification: Chat Prompting Enhancement Suite

**Feature Branch**: `009-chat-prompting-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add four features for chat prompting: (1) conversation threading, (2) exportable chat logs, (3) prompt suggestion tool, (4) context retention across sessions."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Conversation Threading (Priority: P1)

Users need to organize and manage multiple conversation threads to keep different topics, projects, or contexts separate and easily accessible. This includes creating new threads, switching between threads, and maintaining clear visual separation of conversations.

**Why this priority**: Conversation threading is fundamental for organizing complex discussions and maintaining context across different topics without confusion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple threads, switching between them, and verifying that each thread maintains its separate conversation history and context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to discuss different topics, **When** they create a new conversation thread, **Then** system opens a separate chat interface with independent context and history
2. **Given** user has multiple active threads, **When** they switch between threads, **Then** system displays the correct conversation history and maintains proper context for each thread
3. **Given** user wants to organize conversations, **When** they rename a thread, **Then** system updates the thread name throughout the interface without losing conversation content
4. **Given** user needs to find specific conversations, **When** they search through thread titles, **Then** system filters and displays relevant threads based on search criteria
5. **Given** user wants to clean up, **When** they archive or delete a thread, **Then** system removes the thread from active view while preserving content if archived

### User Story 2 - Exportable Chat Logs (Priority: P2)

Users need to save and export their conversation history for documentation, sharing, or reference purposes. This includes multiple export formats, selective content export, and organized file structure.

**Why this priority**: Chat log export is essential for professional users who need to document conversations, share transcripts, or maintain records for compliance and reference.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by exporting conversations in different formats and verifying content accuracy, formatting, and file structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has an important conversation, **When** they export the entire thread as PDF, **Then** system generates a formatted document with timestamps, speaker labels, and proper layout
2. **Given** user needs to share with colleagues, **When** they export conversation as JSON, **Then** system provides structured data with metadata, timestamps, and message hierarchy
3. **Given** user wants to extract specific content, **When** they select date range or message filters, **Then** system exports only the messages matching the specified criteria
4. **Given** user needs analysis data, **When** they export as CSV, **Then** system provides tabular format with columns for timestamp, speaker, message content, and metadata
5. **Given** user wants to preserve formatting, **When** they export as Markdown, **Then** system generates properly formatted text with headers, lists, and code blocks preserved

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered Prompt Suggestion Tool (Priority: P2)

Users need intelligent prompt suggestions to improve their questioning techniques, explore new topics, and overcome creative blocks. The system should analyze conversation context and provide relevant prompt suggestions.

**Why this priority**: Prompt suggestions help users formulate better questions and discover new conversation paths, enhancing the overall chat experience and productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by engaging in conversations and verifying that suggested prompts are contextually relevant and helpful.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is discussing a technical topic, **When** they click "Suggest Prompts", **Then** system provides relevant follow-up questions based on current conversation context
2. **Given** user seems stuck or uncertain, **When** system detects hesitation patterns, **Then** it proactively offers prompt suggestions to continue the conversation
3. **Given** user wants to explore different angles, **When** they select "Explore Topic" option, **Then** system suggests prompts from different perspectives (technical, creative, practical)
4. **Given** user is new to the platform, **When** they start their first conversation, **Then** system provides getting-started prompt suggestions and conversation templates
5. **Given** user has specific goals, **When** they input conversation objectives, **Then** system generates goal-oriented prompt suggestions to achieve desired outcomes

### User Story 4 - Context Retention Across Sessions (Priority: P1)

Users need their conversation context, preferences, and important information to persist across browser sessions and device restarts. This includes conversation history, user preferences, and working context restoration.

**Why this priority**: Context retention is essential for user productivity and experience continuity, preventing loss of important conversations and preferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by closing/reopening the browser or switching devices and verifying that conversations and settings are preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user was in the middle of a conversation, **When** they close and reopen the browser, **Then** system restores the exact conversation state with all messages and context intact
2. **Given** user had multiple open threads, **When** they return to the application, **Then** system restores all active threads with their proper conversation histories
3. **Given** user had specific preferences set, **When** they start a new session, **Then** system maintains language settings, theme preferences, and other customizations
4. **Given** user was working on complex task, **When** system detects extended inactivity, **Then** it preserves context and offers to restore the working state upon return
5. **Given** user switches devices, **When** they log in on a different device, **Then** system synchronizes conversation history and preferences across devices

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user has too many active conversation threads?
- How does system handle export failures due to large conversation size?
- What happens when prompt suggestion API is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when context restoration fails due to data corruption?
- How does system handle concurrent access to the same conversation from multiple devices?
- What happens when user's session expires during active conversation?
