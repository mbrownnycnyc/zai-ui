# Feature Specification: Image-to-Video Enhancement Suite

**Feature Branch**: `007-text-to-video-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add four features for image-to-video: (1) multi-image upload, (2) animation style options, (3) frame rate control, (4) video preview before final render."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Multi-Image Upload and Sequencing (Priority: P1)

Users need to upload multiple images and arrange them in a specific sequence to create dynamic video content. The system should support drag-and-drop functionality, automatic image optimization, and intelligent sequencing based on user preferences.

**Why this priority**: Multi-image upload is the core functionality that enables users to transform static images into engaging video narratives.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading multiple images, arranging them in sequence, and generating a complete video that displays images in the specified order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has 5-10 images, **When** they drag and drop them into the upload area, **Then** system accepts all valid image formats and displays them as a sequence
2. **Given** user wants to change image order, **When** they drag images to new positions in the sequence, **Then** system updates the order and provides visual feedback
3. **Given** user uploads images of different sizes, **When** system processes them, **Then** images are automatically optimized for consistent video output while maintaining aspect ratios
4. **Given** user uploads an invalid file format, **When** system validates files, **Then** invalid files are rejected with clear error messages

---

### User Story 2 - Animation Style Options (Priority: P2)

Users need various animation styles to transition between images and create engaging visual effects. The system should provide multiple animation presets including fades, slides, zooms, and 3D effects with customizable parameters.

**Why this priority**: Animation styles are essential for creating professional-looking videos that maintain viewer interest and convey different emotional tones.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting different animation styles and generating videos that demonstrate smooth transitions between images with the specified effects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants elegant transitions, **When** they select "Fade" animation style, **Then** system creates smooth opacity-based transitions between consecutive images
2. **Given** user needs dynamic presentation, **When** they choose "Slide" animation with direction options, **Then** system applies horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sliding transitions
3. **Given** user wants dramatic effect, **When** they select "Zoom and Pan" style, **Then** system creates zooming and panning motions to highlight different areas of images
4. **Given** user needs professional look, **When** they choose "3D Rotation" animation, **Then** system applies perspective-based rotational transitions between images
5. **Given** user wants subtle motion, **When** they select "Cross Dissolve" with adjustable speed, **Then** system creates gradual overlapping transitions with customizable duration

### User Story 3 - Flexible Video Specifications (Priority: P2)

Users need to select from multiple video resolution and duration combinations based on their specific use case requirements, whether for social media content, professional presentations, or high-quality productions. The system should provide predefined options with appropriate quality settings and processing time expectations.

**Why this priority**: Different platforms and use cases require different video specifications - social media needs shorter content while professional presentations may require higher resolution and longer duration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating videos with different resolution/duration combinations and verifying appropriate quality, file sizes, and processing times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user needs social media content, **When** they select "Basic" option (720p, 30 seconds max), **Then** system generates optimized video with quick processing time
2. **Given** user needs general content, **When** they select "Standard" option (1080p, 2 minutes max), **Then** system creates HD quality video with standard processing time
3. **Given** user requires professional production, **When** they select "High" option (4K, 5 minutes max), **Then** system generates premium quality video with extended processing time
4. **Given** user wants custom specifications, **When** they input custom resolution and duration, **Then** system validates parameters and provides processing time estimate
5. **Given** user selects different specifications, **Then** processing time scales appropriately with complexity (resolution × duration)

---

### User Story 2 - Frame Rate Control (Priority: P3)

Users need to control video frame rates to achieve different visual effects and optimize for various playback platforms. The system should support standard frame rates (24fps, 30fps, 60fps) with smooth motion rendering and platform-specific optimization.

**Why this priority**: Frame rate control is crucial for achieving desired motion characteristics and ensuring compatibility with different social media platforms and playback devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating the same video at different frame rates and verifying smooth motion playback and file size differences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants cinematic quality, **When** they select 24fps frame rate, **Then** system generates video with film-like motion characteristics
2. **Given** user targets social media platforms, **When** they choose 30fps frame rate, **Then** system creates video optimized for standard web playback
3. **Given** user needs ultra-smooth motion, **When** they select 60fps frame rate, **Then** system generates high-frame-rate video with fluid motion rendering
4. **Given** user wants custom settings, **When** they input a custom frame rate between 15-120fps, **Then** system validates and applies the specified frame rate
5. **Given** user needs slow-motion effects, **When** they enable high frame rate capture with slow-motion playback, **Then** system creates smooth slow-motion video segments

---

### User Story 4 - Video Preview Before Final Render (Priority: P1)

Users need to preview their complete video projects before committing to the final high-quality render process. This includes real-time preview of all effects, transitions, and timing with complexity-based processing estimates and the ability to make adjustments.

**Why this priority**: Preview functionality is critical for user satisfaction and workflow efficiency, allowing users to iterate and perfect their videos before time-consuming final renders.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a video project, previewing it with all effects, and confirming the preview matches the final rendered output quality and timing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has arranged images and selected animation styles, **When** they click "Preview Video", **Then** system displays real-time preview with all transitions and effects applied
2. **Given** user wants to check specific timing, **When** they use preview timeline controls, **Then** system allows scrubbing through the video and pausing at any point
3. **Given** user needs quality assessment, **When** they select preview quality settings, **Then** system provides options for quick preview (lower quality) or high-quality preview
4. **Given** user wants processing time estimates, **When** they review project complexity, **Then** system provides estimated render time based on video length, resolution, and effects complexity
5. **Given** user wants to make adjustments, **When** they identify issues during preview, **Then** system allows them to return to editing and make changes without re-rendering
