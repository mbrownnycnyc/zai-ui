# Feature Specification: Dark Theme Web UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a web UI with a dark theme based on image_dark_theme.png, ensuring responsive design for mobile and desktop browsers."

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of a dark-themed web interface with basic navigation and content areas. The scope includes visual design, responsive layout for mobile and desktop, but does not include specific application functionality (e.g., forms, data processing, user authentication).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Navigate Interface (Priority: P1)

Users can access the web interface and navigate through different sections using the dark theme design. The interface should provide a visually consistent dark color scheme that matches the reference design while maintaining full functionality.

**Why this priority**: Essential for the feature's core purpose - users must be able to see and interact with the dark-themed interface

**Independent Test**: Users can load the interface in a browser and verify that the dark theme displays correctly and navigation elements are functional

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the web interface, **When** the page loads, **Then** all elements display with dark theme colors matching the reference design
2. **Given** the dark theme interface is loaded, **When** users interact with navigation elements, **Then** all interactive elements respond appropriately and maintain theme consistency

### User Story 2 - Access Responsive Design (Priority: P1)

Users can access the interface on mobile and desktop devices and experience a layout that adapts appropriately to their screen size while maintaining the dark theme and functionality.

**Why this priority**: Critical for modern web usage - users expect interfaces to work across their devices

**Independent Test**: Interface can be tested on different screen sizes using browser dev tools or actual devices to verify responsive behavior

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the interface on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout adapts to mobile screen width while maintaining dark theme and functionality
2. **Given** a user accesses the interface on a desktop device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout utilizes available screen space appropriately with dark theme
3. **Given** a user resizes their browser window, **When** the width changes between breakpoints, **Then** the layout smoothly transitions between responsive states

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the reference image (image_dark_theme.png) is not available?
- How does system handle browser compatibility issues with older browsers?
- What occurs when users have custom browser zoom levels above 200%?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### CLI Accessibility Requirements
*Per Constitution: CLI Interface Accessibility principle*

- **CLI-001**: System MUST expose all functionality via command-line interface
- **CLI-002**: System MUST support stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr protocol
- **CLI-003**: System MUST support JSON + human-readable output formats

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a web interface with dark theme color scheme
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement responsive design that adapts to mobile and desktop screen sizes
- **FR-003**: System MUST support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) latest stable versions
- **FR-004**: System MUST support mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) latest stable versions
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain functionality when browser font sizes are increased up to 200%
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide appropriate touch targets for mobile device interaction

### Key Entities

- **Theme Configuration**: Collection of color values, typography settings, and styling rules that define the dark theme appearance
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Set of screen width thresholds that trigger layout adaptations for mobile and desktop devices
- **Browser Support**: Configuration of supported browsers and compatibility requirements
- **Layout Components**: Reusable UI elements that adapt to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Interface loads completely in under 3 seconds on standard broadband connection
- **SC-002**: Layout remains functional and readable across mobile (320px+) and desktop (1024px+) screen widths
- **SC-003**: Interface displays correctly in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) latest stable versions
- **SC-004**: Interface displays correctly in mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) latest stable versions
- **SC-005**: Visual design matches reference image (image_dark_theme.png) with 90% similarity in color scheme and layout structure
