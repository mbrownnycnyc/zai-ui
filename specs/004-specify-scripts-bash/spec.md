# Feature Specification: Image Generation

**Feature Branch**: `004-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an image generation feature using z.ai API, supporting user-defined parameters (style, resolution, aspect ratio)."

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of image generation using z.ai API integration. The scope includes text-to-image generation processing, customizable style parameters, resolution and aspect ratio selection, and result management. This feature does not include image editing capabilities, advanced AI model training, or custom visual effects beyond what z.ai API provides.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Generate Images with Text Prompts (Priority: P1)

Users can enter text prompts describing the images they want to generate and receive created images using the z.ai API. The system processes the text description and creates images based on the content with default settings.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the feature - users must be able to generate images from text prompts to get value from the system

**Independent Test**: Users can enter a text prompt and generate an image with default settings without accessing other user stories

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the image generation interface, **When** they enter a valid text prompt, **Then** the system submits the request to z.ai API
2. **Given** an image generation request is submitted, **When** processing completes, **Then** the user receives a downloadable generated image

---

### User Story 2 - Customize Style, Resolution, and Aspect Ratio (Priority: P1)

Users can customize the style, resolution, and aspect ratio of their generated images. The system provides various style options, resolution settings, and aspect ratio selections for image personalization.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user value - customization allows users to create images that meet their specific needs and preferences

**Independent Test**: Users can customize image parameters and generate images without needing to access other features

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user enters a text prompt, **When** they select a custom style, resolution, and aspect ratio, **Then** the system applies these settings during image generation
2. **Given** multiple style options are available, **When** the user selects a specific style, **Then** the generated image reflects the chosen artistic style

---

### User Story 3 - Access and Download Generated Images (Priority: P1)

Users can preview, download, and manage their previously generated images from text prompts. The system provides a library of generated images with metadata about the prompts and settings used.

**Why this priority**: Critical for delivering value - users need to access and use the images they've generated

**Independent Test**: Users can access their image library and download previously generated images without creating new ones

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an image generation is complete, **When** the user accesses their image library, **Then** they can preview the image before downloading
2. **Given** a user wants to save a generated image, **When** they click download, **Then** the system provides the image file

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when z.ai API is unavailable or experiencing issues?
- How does system handle inappropriate or policy-violating text prompts?
- What occurs when image generation fails midway through processing?
- How does system handle very long text prompts or complex requests?
- What happens when user's internet connection is lost during generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### CLI Accessibility Requirements
*Per Constitution: CLI Interface Accessibility principle*

- **CLI-001**: System MUST expose all functionality via command-line interface
- **CLI-002**: System MUST support stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr protocol
- **CLI-003**: System MUST support JSON + human-readable output formats

- **FR-008**: System MUST provide image preview functionality before download
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable image download in various formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle API errors and provide user-friendly error messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user history of generated images with prompt metadata
- **FR-012**: System MUST estimate generation time based on prompt complexity and selected settings

### Key Entities

- **Text Prompt**: User-provided description of the desired image content and style
- **Generation Request**: User submission containing text prompt, style preferences, resolution, and aspect ratio settings
- **Style Setting**: User-configurable artistic style applied during image generation
- **Resolution Setting**: User-configurable output quality and dimensions for generated images
- **Aspect Ratio Setting**: User-configurable proportional dimensions for image format
- **Generation Job**: Processing task that tracks image creation progress, status, and resource usage
- **Generated Image**: Final image file produced from text prompt with applied customizations
- **User History**: Collection of user's previous image generation requests and results
- **API Configuration**: Connection settings and credentials for z.ai API integration

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
