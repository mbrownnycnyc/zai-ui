# Feature Specification: Persistent Storage System

**Feature Branch**: `006-persistent-storage`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement a persistent storage system for chats, images, and videos, with user-accessible history and search functionality."

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of a persistent storage system that allows users to store, access, and search multiple types of content including chat conversations, images, and videos. The scope includes data persistence, user-accessible history, search functionality, and content management capabilities. This feature does not include content editing/modification, real-time collaboration features, or advanced analytics beyond basic search functionality.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Store Content Persistently (Priority: P1)

Users can store chat conversations, images, and videos in a persistent storage system that maintains data integrity and accessibility over time. Content remains available even after sessions end or system restarts.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the feature - without persistent storage, users cannot rely on the system to maintain their valuable content

**Independent Test**: Users can store content, close their session, and later retrieve the same content without data loss or corruption

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has created chat content, **When** they save it to storage, **Then** the content is persistently stored and accessible later
2. **Given** a user uploads images or videos, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the media files are stored persistently with metadata intact

---

### User Story 2 - Search and Access Stored Content (Priority: P1)

Users can search through their stored content using text-based queries and access specific items from their storage history. The system provides search results matching the query criteria and allows users to retrieve and view the found content.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user value - stored content must be discoverable and accessible to be useful

**Independent Test**: Users can search for previously stored content and successfully access matching items

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has stored content, **When** they search using relevant keywords, **Then** the system returns matching results from their stored content
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user selects an item, **Then** they can view the full content in its original format

---

### User Story 3 - View Storage History and Manage Content (Priority: P2)

Users can browse their complete storage history organized chronologically and perform basic content management operations like viewing details, organizing content, and understanding storage usage.

**Why this priority**: Important for content organization and user control over their stored data

**Independent Test**: Users can navigate through their storage history and manage content without using search functionality

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has stored multiple content items, **When** they access their storage history, **Then** they can browse items organized by date and content type
2. **Given** browsing storage history, **When** a user selects an item, **Then** they can view detailed information and perform management actions

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Format Content Support (Priority: P2)

Users can store and retrieve different content formats (text chats, images, videos) through a unified interface, with appropriate handling for each content type's specific requirements.

**Why this priority**: Critical for comprehensive storage solution - users need to work with multiple content types seamlessly

**Independent Test**: Users can store and successfully retrieve each supported content type (chat text, images, videos)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user stores chat conversations, **When** they retrieve them later, **Then** the formatting and structure are preserved
2. **Given** a user stores image files, **When** they retrieve them later, **Then** the images display with original quality and metadata
3. **Given** a user stores video files, **When** they retrieve them later, **Then** the videos play correctly with proper quality and duration

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user exceeds 10GB storage limit?
- How does system handle annual content rolling with user notifications?
- How does system handle corrupted or unreadable files during retrieval?
- What occurs when search queries return extremely large result sets?
- How does system handle concurrent access to the same stored content?
- What happens when users attempt to store unsupported file formats?
- How does system handle network interruptions during upload/download operations?
- What occurs when content metadata becomes corrupted or inconsistent?
- How does system handle very large file uploads that timeout or fail midway?

### API Integration Constraints

Based on z.ai API capability analysis:

- **Storage Backend**: z.ai does not provide persistent storage APIs - must implement custom storage solution
- **File Upload Limitations**: z.ai file upload API only supports temporary storage (100MB max, 180 days retention)
- **Content Processing**: No built-in thumbnail generation or metadata extraction APIs - must implement locally
- **Search Functionality**: z.ai provides web search API but stored content search must be implemented independently
- **Authentication**: z.ai API key authentication available for securing storage API endpoints
- **Performance**: Standard API rate limits sufficient, no performance constraints identified
