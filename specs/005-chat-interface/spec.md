# Feature Specification: Chat Interface

**Feature Branch**: `005-chat-interface`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a chat interface for conversational prompting with z.ai LLM, supporting real-time interaction and markdown formatting"

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of a real-time chat interface for conversational interaction with z.ai LLM. The scope includes chat message exchange, markdown formatting support, conversation context management, and real-time response streaming. This feature does not include advanced conversation features like multi-user chat, file sharing within chat, or custom AI model training beyond what z.ai LLM provides.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Start Real-time Conversations with z.ai LLM (Priority: P1)

Users can initiate and maintain real-time conversations with the z.ai LLM through a dedicated chat interface. The system processes user messages and streams responses back in real-time, maintaining conversation context throughout the session.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the feature - users must be able to have real-time conversations with the AI to get value from the system

**Independent Test**: Users can start a conversation, send messages, and receive real-time responses without accessing other user stories

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the chat interface, **When** they send a message, **Then** the system establishes a real-time connection with z.ai LLM
2. **Given** a user sends a message, **When** the LLM responds, **Then** the user receives the response as a real-time stream

---

### User Story 2 - View Markdown-Formatted Responses (Priority: P1)

Users can view LLM responses rendered with proper markdown formatting, including headers, lists, code blocks, and other markdown elements for improved readability and content structure.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience - markdown formatting makes AI responses more readable and useful

**Independent Test**: Users can send messages and receive properly formatted responses without needing other features

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM response contains markdown formatting, **When** the response is displayed, **Then** all markdown elements are properly rendered
2. **Given** a response includes code blocks or formatted text, **When** displayed, **Then** formatting preserves structure and readability

---

### User Story 3 - Maintain Conversation Context (Priority: P1)

Users can engage in extended conversations where the LLM maintains awareness of previous messages and context, allowing for coherent multi-turn dialogues and follow-up questions.

**Why this priority**: Critical for conversational experience - context awareness enables natural, flowing conversations

**Independent Test**: Users can have multi-turn conversations where the LLM remembers and references previous messages

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sends a follow-up question, **When** the LLM responds, **Then** the response demonstrates awareness of previous conversation context
2. **Given** an ongoing conversation, **When** a user references previous messages, **Then** the LLM can understand and respond appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when z.ai LLM service is unavailable or experiencing issues?
- How does system handle network connectivity interruptions during real-time streaming?
- What occurs when markdown parsing fails or encounters malformed content?
- How does system handle very long conversations or memory limits?
- What happens when user input contains inappropriate or policy-violating content?
- How does system handle concurrent chat sessions or multiple browser tabs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
