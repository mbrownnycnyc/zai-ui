# Feature Specification: Image Generation Enhancement Suite

**Feature Branch**: `008-image-generation-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add four features for image generation: (1) batch processing, (2) color palette customization, (3) downloadable metadata, (4) AI image quality optimization."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Batch Processing Capabilities (Priority: P2)

Users need to process multiple images simultaneously with consistent settings to save time and maintain visual coherence across projects. This includes batch generation with consistent parameters and batch color adjustments.

**Why this priority**: Batch processing is essential for professional workflows where users need to process large numbers of images efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting multiple images and applying batch operations, then verifying all images are processed consistently and saved properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has 5-10 images, **When** they select all images and choose batch generation, **Then** system generates images with consistent parameters and quality
2. **Given** user needs consistent styling, **When** they apply batch color adjustments, **Then** all images maintain consistent color schemes
3. **Given** user wants efficient workflow, **When** they set up batch processing with multiple operations, **Then** system executes operations in sequence without user intervention
4. **Given** user needs progress tracking, **When** batch processing runs, **Then** system shows real-time progress for each image in the batch
5. **Given** user encounters errors, **When** some images fail processing, **Then** system continues processing remaining images and provides error report

### User Story 2 - AI Image Quality Optimization (Priority: P2)

Users need to optimize image quality using available AI generation parameters and quality enhancement settings. The system should provide multiple quality settings and optimization options within the z.ai API capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Quality optimization is crucial for users who need high-quality images for professional use and consistent output.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating images with different quality settings and comparing clarity, detail, and overall aesthetic quality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants standard quality, **When** they select "Standard Quality" mode (10-30 seconds), **Then** system generates images with balanced quality and processing speed
2. **Given** user needs maximum quality, **When** they select "High Quality" mode (30-60 seconds), **Then** system creates images with enhanced details and clarity
3. **Given** user wants quick results, **When** they choose "Fast Generation" mode (under 10 seconds), **Then** system provides faster processing with acceptable quality
4. **Given** user has specific requirements, **When** they adjust generation parameters like guidance scale and sampling steps, **Then** system applies these settings to optimize output quality
5. **Given** user needs consistent results, **When** they use the same quality settings, **Then** system maintains consistent output quality across multiple generations

### User Story 3 - Advanced Color Palette Customization (Priority: P3)

Users want to control and customize the color schemes of their generated images to match brand guidelines, artistic preferences, or specific mood requirements. The system should provide color palette selection, custom color input, and automatic color harmony tools.

**Why this priority**: Color control is essential for professional applications where brand consistency and specific color schemes are required.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying different color palettes to the same image and verifying accurate color reproduction and harmony.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants warm tones, **When** they select "Autumn" color palette, **Then** system transforms image colors to warm oranges, reds, and browns
2. **Given** user needs brand colors, **When** they input custom hex color codes, **Then** system applies these colors to the image while maintaining visual harmony
3. **Given** user wants monochromatic look, **When** they select "Monochrome" palette, **Then** system converts image to single-color variations
4. **Given** user needs color inspiration, **When** they use "Color Harmony Generator", **Then** system suggests complementary color schemes based on image content
5. **Given** user wants fine control, **When** they adjust individual color channel sliders (RGB, HSL), **Then** system applies precise color adjustments in real-time

### User Story 4 - Multiple Resolution Options (Priority: P2)

Users need to select from multiple image resolution options based on their specific use case requirements, whether for web display, print media, or professional applications. The system should provide predefined resolution options with appropriate aspect ratios and quality settings.

**Why this priority**: Different use cases require different resolutions - web content needs smaller files while print media requires higher resolution for quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating the same image at different resolutions and verifying appropriate quality, file sizes, and aspect ratios.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user needs web-optimized images, **When** they select "Standard" resolution (1024x1024), **Then** system generates images optimized for web use with fast processing
2. **Given** user needs print-ready images, **When** they select "High" resolution (2048x2048), **Then** system creates high-resolution images suitable for print media
3. **Given** user requires professional-grade quality, **When** they select "Ultra" resolution (4096x4096), **Then** system generates premium quality images with extended processing time
4. **Given** user wants specific dimensions, **When** they choose custom resolution settings, **Then** system generates images at specified dimensions while maintaining quality
5. **Given** user selects different resolutions, **Then** processing time scales appropriately with resolution (higher = longer processing)

### User Story 5 - Comprehensive Downloadable Metadata (Priority: P1)

Users need access to detailed metadata about their generated images including generation parameters, AI model information, and licensing details. This metadata should be downloadable in various formats for documentation and compliance purposes.

**Why this priority**: Metadata is crucial for professional users who need to track generation parameters, ensure compliance, and maintain documentation for commercial use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating an image and downloading its metadata in different formats, then verifying all information is accurate and complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user generates an image, **When** they download metadata as JSON, **Then** system provides complete generation parameters, timestamps, and model information
2. **Given** user needs human-readable format, **When** they download metadata as PDF report, **Then** system generates formatted document with all technical and creative details
3. **Given** user requires compliance information, **When** they view metadata, **Then** system includes licensing terms, usage rights, and attribution requirements
4. **Given** user wants technical details, **When** they access metadata, **Then** system includes AI model version, generation settings, and performance metrics
5. **Given** user needs batch metadata, **When** they process multiple images, **Then** system provides consolidated metadata file for all images in the batch
