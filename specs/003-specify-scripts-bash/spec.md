# Feature Specification: Image-to-Video Generation

**Feature Branch**: `003-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop image-to-video generation, allowing users to upload images and generate videos via z.ai API, with customizable duration and transitions."

**Scope**: This feature covers the implementation of image-to-video generation using z.ai API integration. The scope includes image upload functionality, video generation processing, customizable duration settings, transition effects, and result management. This feature does not include image editing capabilities, advanced video editing beyond basic transitions, or custom AI model training beyond what z.ai API provides.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Upload Image and Generate Video (Priority: P1)

Users can upload images and generate videos from them using the z.ai API. The system processes the uploaded image and creates a video based on the visual content with default settings.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the feature - users must be able to convert images to videos to get value from the system

**Independent Test**: Users can upload an image and generate a video with default settings without accessing other user stories

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the image-to-video interface, **When** they upload a valid image file, **Then** the system submits the request to z.ai API
2. **Given** a video generation request is submitted, **When** processing completes, **Then** the user receives a downloadable generated video

---

### User Story 2 - Customize Video Duration and Transitions (Priority: P1)

Users can customize the duration of their generated videos and select transition effects to be applied. The system provides various duration options and transition types for video personalization.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user value - customization allows users to create videos that meet their specific needs and preferences

**Independent Test**: Users can customize video settings and generate videos without needing to access other features

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user uploads an image, **When** they select a custom duration and transition effect, **Then** the system applies these settings during video generation
2. **Given** multiple transition options are available, **When** the user selects a specific transition, **Then** the generated video includes the chosen transition effect

---

### User Story 3 - Access and Download Generated Videos (Priority: P1)

Users can preview, download, and manage their previously generated videos from images. The system provides a library of generated videos with metadata about the source images and settings used.

**Why this priority**: Critical for delivering value - users need to access and use the videos they've generated

**Independent Test**: Users can access their video library and download previously generated videos without creating new ones

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video generation is complete, **When** the user accesses their video library, **Then** they can preview the video before downloading
2. **Given** a user wants to save a generated video, **When** they click download, **Then** the system provides the video file

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when z.ai API is unavailable or experiencing issues?
- How does system handle unsupported image formats or corrupted image files?
- What occurs when video generation fails midway through processing?
- How does system handle very large image files or extremely long duration requests?
- What happens when user's internet connection is lost during generation?
- How does system handle inappropriate or policy-violating image content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### CLI Accessibility Requirements
*Per Constitution: CLI Interface Accessibility principle*

- **CLI-001**: System MUST expose all functionality via command-line interface
- **CLI-002**: System MUST support stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr protocol
- **CLI-003**: System MUST support JSON + human-readable output formats
