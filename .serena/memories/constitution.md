# ZAI-UI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Development
Prioritize reusable, well-documented libraries over monolithic code. Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, and serve a clear purpose - no organizational-only abstractions.

### II. CLI Interface Accessibility
Ensure all functionality is accessible via command-line interface. Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr. Support JSON + human-readable formats for maximum compatibility.

### III. Test-First Implementation
Write tests before implementation code. TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced.

### IV. Integration-First Testing
Focus on integration tests over unit tests where possible. Priority areas: New library contract tests, contract changes, inter-service communication, shared schemas, and user workflows.

### V. Anti-Abstraction Principle
Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers and complexity. Start simple, follow YAGNI principles. Complexity must be justified with concrete user value.

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
